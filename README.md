# Cocktail Recipe Finder  

[Link to Project](https://jjiang95.github.io/phase-1-final-project)

Welcome to my final project of Phase 1 at Flatiron Software Development Bootcamp! This web app pulls data from [TheCocktailDB](https://www.thecocktaildb.com/api.php), a free, crowd-sourced database, and renders search results into flippable card graphics. No installation required, as this app is hosted on GitHub Pages.

# Usage

Simply enter a search term in either search bar (cocktail name OR ingredient) and press "submit". Then click on the card(s) that populate to reveal ingredients, measurements, and mixing instructions. Click "clear gallery" to reset the DOM and remove all cards. The "random" button generates a random cocktail recipe.
